✨✨Latest Advances on Multimodal Sentiment Analysis

# 🎨 Introduction 
Multimodal Sentiment Analysis is a computational task that aims to detect and interpret sentiment or emotional states by integrating heterogeneous data from multiple modalities, such as language (text or speech), vision (facial expressions or visual scenes), and audio (tone, pitch, prosody). The objective is to leverage the complementary and synergistic cues from different modalities to achieve a more robust and nuanced understanding of human affective expressions.
